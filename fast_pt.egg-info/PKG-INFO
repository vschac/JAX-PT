# FAST-PT

FAST-PT is a code to calculate quantities in cosmological perturbation theory
at 1-loop (including, e.g., corrections to the matter power spectrum). The code
utilizes Fourier methods combined with analytic expressions to reduce the
computation time to scale as N log N, where N is the number of grid points in
the input linear power spectrum.

NOTE: v3.1.0 and earlier require numpy version < 1.24. This is fixed in v3.1.1 and later, which is available on pip and conda.

Easy installation with pip:

* `pip install fast-pt`
* Note: use `--no-deps` if you use a conda python distribution, or just use conda installation

Easy installation with conda:

* `conda install fast-pt`

Full installation with examples:

* Make sure you have current version of numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
* download the latest FAST-PT release (or clone the repo)
* install the repo: `python -m pip install .`
* run the example: `cd examples && python fastpt_example.py`
* hopefully you get a plot!

See the [user manual](docs/usr_manual.pdf) for more details.
