FAST-PT Documentation
====================

FAST-PT is a code to calculate quantities in cosmological perturbation theory at 1-loop (including, e.g., corrections to the matter power spectrum). The code utilizes Fourier methods combined with analytic expressions to reduce the computation time to scale as N log N, where N is the number of grid points in the input linear power spectrum.
